# CS3 Computer Communications and Networks

This repository contains my coursework for the 3rd Year [Computer Communications and Networks](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/comn) course, taken in 2010/2011. The coursework involved implementing four protocols for sending data: a naive send-and-forget UDP protocol, a stop-and-wait protocol, a go-back-N protocol, and a selective repeat protocol. The coursework was performed using a virtual machine to fake a controllable network; however all but the first protocol should work using a normal computer network regardless. Information on building and running the code can be found in the original submission's README (README.ORIGINAL).

Coursework for other courses can be found in my main [University Coursework](https://github.com/stephenmcgruer/University) repository.
